## How It Works

1. **Tab Categorization**:  
   The extension identifies open tabs and categorizes them based on default domain lists and user-defined keywords. Tabs are organized into categories like **Work**, **Research**, **Entertainment**, and **Others**.

2. **Tab Grouping**:  
   After categorization, the extension utilizes Chrome's native tab grouping feature to group the tabs under the relevant category name.

3. **Keyword-based Customization**:  
   Users can add custom keywords for each category. The extension will search the tab titles and URLs for these keywords to categorize them accurately.

4. **Add and Remove Categories**:  
   Users can create new custom categories or delete existing ones. This allows for greater flexibility and personalization in organizing tabs.
